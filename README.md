# plox

plox is a translation of the jlox interpreter described in the first half of Bob Nystrom's _Crafting Interpreters_.
Right now it is a very simplistic and direct translation of the original Java.
Once it is complete I intend to refactor the interpreter into a more pythonic style (or at least my interpretation of what that means.)
